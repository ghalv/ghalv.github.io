<p>The problem about Latin is that you can study it for six years
and still not be able to read a Latin sentence.</p>

<p>If you study French, you get pretty quickly
to a point where you process a French sentence in much the same
way you process an English one: &quot;J'ai lu tous les livres&quot;
comes across to you as &quot;I've read all the books&quot; and
you don't think much about it.</p>

<p>In Latin, you can still be looking at a
sentence six years later and doing what I call a &quot;crossword
puzzle&quot; reading of it. <img class=resright src="pix/Caesar.gif" alt="bilde" title="bilde">
You find a masculine noun in the ablative singular, then you go hunting
around the sentence for an adjective to go with the noun, and
if you find one you set those two words aside mentally and go
back and look at the verbs.</p>

<p>In short, you're trying to read the sentence
somewhat as one assembles a model airplane from a kit: looking
at the directions and fitting the parts together and hoping it
all makes sense.</p>

<p>The reason this happens is that Latin is
a &quot;highly inflected&quot; language and the other modern
European languages mostly aren't.</p>

<p>I'll explain &quot;highly inflected&quot;
below, but what this means for the short term is that French
syntax or German syntax or Italian syntax works pretty much the
same way as the English syntax you're used to (subject-verb-predicate,
subject-verb-predicate), while Latin doesn't. So you can study
it for six years without really learning how to &quot;sweep up&quot;
a sentence the way you're reading this sentence right now.</p>

<h2>Is There a Recipe for Disaster?</h2>

<p>Suppose you want to make sure that, no
matter how many years you put into studying Latin, you'll never
be able to really &quot;read&quot; a sentence. Is there a recipe
for disaster here?</p>

<p>There is.</p>

<p>Here's how to do it: (1) begin studying
from Wheelock's <i>Latin: An Introductory Course Based on Ancient
Authors</i>, (2) following the book, learn little snippets of
Latin grammar, always moving around among categories so that
you're thoroughly confused -- e.g., study a couple of verb forms
the first week, then learn a noun declension, then learn a different
verb tense, then move to adjectives -- and (3) make sure that
your reading consists of short sentences taken from Latin authors
about how the Romans hated money.</p>

<p>This way, you can make sure that you'll
never be able to read Latin even if you study it for forty years.
It passes the time.</p>

<h2>Is There a Recipe for Success?</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>It's described in this guide.</p>

<p>It goes as follows: (1) learn a few simple
concepts necessary for understanding Latin grammar -- what the
&quot;case&quot; of a noun is, for instance -- then (2) sit down
and systematically learn the main categories of Latin grammar
by &quot;brute memorization,&quot; and (3) begin reading a great
direct-method Latin reader entitled <i>Lingua Latina</i>, doing
all the end-of-chapter exercises and making sure you understand
every word of every sentence.</p>

<p>If you follow this method, you can learn
to actually read Latin -- again, to read Latin sentences in the
same way you're reading this one -- in about two years of daily
work.</p>

<p>Two years sounds like a long time, but
it's really nothing in comparison to the world that opens up
when you can sit down and read Livy and understand what you're
reading. This is like growing wings, or being born into another
existence.</p>

<h2>What Are These Grammatical Concepts I've Got to Learn?</h2>

<p>This is the easy part.</p>

<p>In what follows, I'm going to introduce
you to the main concepts and explain them. If you read them with
perfect comprehension, you'll be ready to start memorizing the
grammatical tables in the back of Wheelock (the only thing his
widely-used Latin textbook is any good for).</p>

<p>When you've memorized those, you'll be
ready to start reading volume 1 of <i>Lingua Latina</i>. You'll
be on your way.</p>

<h3>First Concept: Noun Cases</h3>

<p>In English, it is the order of words in
a sentence that tells you what their grammatical function is.
Example:</p>

<pre>The teacher gives a book to the student.</pre>

<p>If you know even a little bit about English
grammar, you will be able to say that the verb in this sentence
is &quot;gives.&quot; (It's the &quot;action&quot; word.) And
once you've found the action word, the grammar of the rest of
the sentence can be figured out by seeing how everything else
relates to the action.</p>

<p>In this sentence, for instance, you can
easily see that &quot;the teacher&quot; is the <i>subject</i>
of the verb. (It's the teacher who's &quot;doing the giving.&quot;)
In the same way, you can see that &quot;the book&quot; is the
<i>direct object</i> of the verb. (The book is what's being given.)
You can then see that &quot;the student&quot; is the <i>indirect
object</i> of the verb. (It's the student to whom the book is
being given.)</p>

<p>Don't just rush past my explanations. Go
back and read over the previous two paragraphs if you didn't
understand them completely. The grammatical concepts I'm presenting
here are very simple, but if you don't understand them completely,
you won't understand the related Latin concepts I'm about to
explain.</p>

<p>Verb = &quot;action word.&quot; Subject
= &quot;doer of the action.&quot; Direct Object = &quot;object
of the action.&quot; Indirect Object = &quot;recipient or beneficiary
of the action.&quot; Okay?</p>

<p>I said that in English and the other modern
European languages, it is word order that determines grammatical
function. Look what happens when we invert the word order of
the sample sentence:</p>

<pre>The student gives a book to the teacher.</pre>

<p>Watch very closely what's going on here.
Note that &quot;the student&quot; is spelled just the same here
as it was in the earlier sentence. So is &quot;the teacher.&quot;
The point is that <i>neither word has changed its form</i>. All
we've done is move &quot;student&quot; up to the front of the
sentence and put &quot;teacher&quot; at the end.</p>

<p>But now, to a speaker of English, the whole
meaning has changed: it's the student who's doing the giving
and the teacher who's doing the receiving of the book. (In grammatical
terms, &quot;the student&quot; has become the subject of the
sentence and &quot;the teacher&quot; has become the indirect
object.)</p>

<p>Do English words ever change their form
to indicate a change in meaning?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre>I <i>bring</i> my lunch to school on Thursdays.
I <i>brought</i> my lunch to school last Thursday.</pre>

<p>The change from <i>bring</i> to <i>brought</i>
signals, in English, a change from the present tense of the verb
to the past tense. <i>Bring</i> is what is called a &quot;strong
verb.&quot; It's left over from an earlier stage of English when
many more words changed their form -- that is, changed the way
they were pronounced and spelled -- bring/brought -- to indicate
a change in grammatical function.</p>

<p>When a language has a lot of words that
change their actual form to signal a change in grammatical function,
that language is said to be &quot;highly inflected.&quot;</p>

<p>In a highly-inflected language, words mainly
show their grammatical function by their form -- that is, you
can tell just by looking at the word in isolation what role it
plays in the sentence: you don't need word order to tell you
-- and so word order doesn't mean as much when you're trying
to figure out grammatical function.</p>

<p>This is an important concept, so make sure
you're following everything here. In the sentences</p>

<pre>The teacher gives a book to the student.</pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre>The student gives a book to the teacher.</pre>

<p>there is simply no way to tell whether
&quot;teacher&quot; and &quot;student&quot; is the subject of
the verb or the indirect object of the verb without looking at
the whole sentence.</p>

<p>Just seeing</p>

<pre>the teacher</pre>

<p>in isolation gives you no grammatical information
at all.</p>

<p>By contrast, in the few cases where English
keeps some of its earlier inflections, you don't need a whole
sentence to tell you what grammatical function the word is fulfilling.
For instance, if you just see</p>

<pre>bring</pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre>brought</pre>

<p>sitting there alone on the page, you can
say that <i>bring</i> is present tense and <i>brought</i> is
past tense.</p>

<p>In Latin, practically every word in a sentence
tells you its grammatical function by its form. Consider this
sentence:</p>

<pre>Magister dat librum discipulo.</pre>

<p>Translation: &quot;The teacher gives a
book to the student.&quot;</p>

<p>For a number of reasons, that's not a very
good Latin sentence, but I want to use it to make a point. The
point is this: to someone who reads Latin, the form of &quot;magister&quot;
says that &quot;magister&quot; is the subject of the verb. (It
is the &quot;magister&quot; who is &quot;doing the giving&quot;
here.)</p>

<p>In the same way, &quot;librum&quot; shows
by its form that it is the direct object of the verb. (The &quot;librum&quot;
is what the magister is giving.)</p>

<p>And finally, &quot;discipulo&quot; shows
by its form that it is the indirect object of the verb. (It is
the &quot;discipulo&quot; who is getting the <i>librum</i> from
the <i>magister</i>.)</p>

<p>Here comes the important part: <b><i>Because each of these nouns shows
its grammatical function by its form, that function doesn't change
even when you switch the word order around in the sentence.</i></b></p>

<p>Remember how we reversed the meaning of</p>

<pre>The teacher gives a book to the student.</pre>

<p>just by reversing the word order?</p>

<pre>The student gives a book to the teacher.</pre>

<p>In Latin, you can put the words of our
example sentence in virtually any order you want, and the <i>magister</i>
keeps on being the person who is doing the giving, the <i>librum</i>
keeps on being the object that is given, and the <i>discipulo</i>
keeps on being the person who is being given the book.</p>

<p>For purely stylistic reasons, some of the
following are sentences no writer of &quot;good&quot; Latin would
ever construct, but in purely grammatical terms they all mean
exactly the same thing:</p>

<pre>Magister dat librum discipulo.

Librum discipulo magister dat.

Discipulo librum magister dat.

Dat discipulo magister librum.

(etc.)</pre>

<p>It gets clumsy after a while to have to
keep on saying that &quot;the nouns in the sentence above retain
their grammatical function so long as they retain the same form,&quot;
so grammarians invented a shorthand way of saying the same thing.
To say what grammatical function a Latin noun shows by the form
in which it is written, you simply mention the <i>case</i> of
the noun.</p>

<p>This is the main &quot;new&quot; grammatical
concept you're going to have to learn to study Latin. When you
memorize Latin nouns -- and, as you'll see, adjectives, which
have to &quot;agree with&quot; the nouns they modify -- what
you really memorize is the cases through which each noun shows
its grammatical function in a sentence.</p>

<h3>Second concept: the nominative</h3>

<p>This is easy. A noun occurs in the nominative
case when it is the subject of the verb. In the sentence</p>

<pre>Magister dat librum discipulo.</pre>

<p>it is the nominative form of <i>magister</i>
that tells you that the <i>magister</i> (teacher) is doing the
giving here.</p>

<p>Every case comes in two &quot;numbers,&quot;
the singular and the plural. Don't let this perplex you. It just
means that sometimes the form of the noun shows you that one
person or thing is involved, and at other times it shows you
that more than one person or thing is involved. Examples:</p>

<pre>Magister dat librum discipulo.

Magistri dant libros discipulis.</pre>

<p>In the second sentence, I've put all the
nouns into the plural number. Each noun is in the same case,
so the meaning of the sentence stays the same: something is being
given by someone to someone else. But in the first sentence it
is a single <i>teacher</i> who is giving a single<i> book</i>
to a single<i> student</i>. In the second sentence it is two
or more<i> teachers</i> who are giving two or more <i>books</i>
to two or more <i>students</i>.</p>

<p>Here's some grammatical jargon that I want
you to make sure you understand. Don't go on until you're absolutely
sure you understand what I'm saying about the two sentences above:
1) In the first sentence &quot;magister&quot; is in the <i>nominative
singular</i>. 2) In the second sentence, &quot;magistri&quot;
is in the <i>nominative plural</i>.</p>

<p>Do you understand that? <i>Nominative</i>
means, in both sentences, that the noun is showing by its form
that it is the subject of the verb. Singular means that the sentence
is talking only about a single &quot;magister.&quot; <i>Plural
</i>means that there are two or more <i>magistri</i> giving away
books.</p>

<h3>Third concept: Accusative and Dative Case</h3>

<p>Now I'm going to speed things up a bit.</p>

<p>Here are some more things you can say about
the two sentences above: 1) In the first sentence, &quot;librum&quot;
is in the <i>accusative singular</i>. 2) In the second sentence,
&quot;libros&quot; is in the a<i>ccusative plural</i>. 3) In
the first sentence, &quot;discipulo&quot; is in the <i>dative
singular.</i> 4) In the second sentence, &quot;discipulis&quot;
is in the <i>dative plural.</i></p>

<p>Do you see what's going on here? The<i>
accusative</i> is the Latin case that shows that a noun is the
direct object of the verb. (The books are the &quot;things being
given&quot; in these sentences.)</p>

<p>The <i>dative</i> is the Latin case that
shows that a noun is the indirect object of the verb. (The students
are the ones &quot;to whom the books are being given&quot; in
both sentences.)</p>

<p>The accusative singular shows that only
one book is being given. The dative singular shows that only
one student is getting or receiving the book. The accusative
plural shows that two or more books are being given. The dative
plural shows that two or more students are getting the books.</p>

<p>When you get farther along with Latin,
you'll learn that cases like the Accusative and the Dative have
other uses as well, but these are the ones you want to start
with.</p>

<h3>Fourth Concept: the Genitive Case</h3>

<p>This one is easy too.</p>

<p>The genitive case in Latin usually signals
some idea of possession. Somebody or something owns or possesses
something else. Here are a couple of simple examples in English
of how the genetive works:</p>

<pre>The boy's hat was bright red.

The roof of the house was made of tile.

The teacher's book is large.</pre>

<p>Now look at the last of these sentences.
I'm about to give you the same sentence in Latin. Here it is:</p>

<pre>Liber magistri magnus est.</pre>

<p>As always, it is the<i> form</i> of the
noun that tells you what the grammatical function is. In technical
terms, you only have to say that &quot;magistri&quot; in the
sentence above is in the genitive case, and to understand what
that means all you have to understand is that the book belongs
to the teacher.</p>

<h3>Fifth Concept: the Ablative Case</h3>

<p>The ablative is the hardest Latin case
to get an &quot;intuitive&quot; feel for, because the Romans
used the ablative for all sorts of different grammatical purposes.</p>

<p>Here's the easiest way to make sense of
the ablative. In Latin, the ablative tends to do the work that
we do in English with common prepositions (<i>of, on, with, by,
for</i>, etc).</p>

<p>Each of these little words signals some
sort of relation between the noun and something else. For instance,
you can say</p>

<pre>The teacher puts the book <i>on</i> the table.</pre>

<p>Here, the relation signalled by the preposition
<i>on</i> is spatial: when the action is complete, one object
(a book) is on top of another object (a table) as a result.</p>

<p>This is exactly what happens with the ablative
in Latin. Here's the same sentence in Latin with &quot;table&quot;
(mensa) in the ablative:</p>

<pre>Magister librum <i>in</i> mensa ponit.</pre>

<p>If you just basically concentrate on this
idea, and then extend what you have understood to all the other
common prepositions in English (again: <i>on, in, with, by, from</i>,
etc), you'll never have trouble with the ablative in Latin.</p>

<p>The key is this: when you see an ablative
in a Latin sentence, ask yourself what <i>relation</i> it is
trying to signal between the noun in the ablative case and everything
else in the sentence. Then you will figure out its meaning &quot;intuitively.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is a warning. The ablative has so
many common uses in Latin that grammarians have figured out names
for a lot of them (&quot;ablative of separation,&quot; &quot;ablative
of the place from which,&quot; &quot;ablative of agent,&quot;
etc).</p>

<p>It is still customary in some Latin courses
to try to get students to understand the ablative by teaching
them these categories.</p>

<p>My advice: forget the categories. They'll
just confuse you, mainly because they get you worrying about
non-essential secondary categories when what you want to know
is what this ablative <i>means</i> in this sentence.</p>

<p>When you're reading your <i>Lingua Latina
</i>chapters, just go with the flow: learn the ablatives as they
come up in the reading, and forget about fancy names for what
they are doing.</p>

<p>In the end, you'll have learned all the
categories, but without confusing yourself. (Once you've learned
how the ablative &quot;works&quot; in its various uses, you can
go and get a grammatical table and learn the categories in 10
minutes. &quot;Oh,&quot; you say to yourself, &quot;that use
is called 'the ablative of the place from which'!&quot; But the
important thing is that you were already understanding what it
meant.)</p>

<h3>Sixth Concept: Adjective Cases</h3>

<p>This isn't really a new concept, but I'm
putting it under a separate heading to emphasize that you've
got to learn adjectives separately from nouns.</p>

<p>The key &quot;concept&quot; is this: adjectives
have to agree with the nouns they modify in number and case.
That sounds hard. In fact, it's incredibly easy. Start with <i>modify</i>.</p>

<p>You may remember from grade school that
adjectives are words that give you new information about nouns.
The grammarians' way of saying this is to say that the adjective
&quot;modifies&quot; the noun. So:</p>

<pre>The teacher had a book.</pre>

<p>All you know about the book at this point
is, so to speak, that it is a book (i.e., a rectangular object
containing print and able to be read by those who understand
the language in which it is printed).</p>

<p>But when you add adjectives to the sentence,
you begin to get more specific ideas about the book:</p>

<pre>The teacher had a large book.

The teacher had a large, old, dusty book.

The teacher had a large, old, dusty, difficult book.</pre>

<p>In each of these instances, you say that
an adjective (&quot;large,&quot; &quot;old,&quot; &quot;dusty,&quot;
&quot;difficult&quot;) is adding something new to (&quot;modifying&quot;)
your idea of the book owned by the teacher.</p>

<p>The point about number and case simply
means that adjectives in Latin have to be singular when the noun
is singular, plural when the noun is plural, and display by their
form the same grammatical function as the noun they are modifying:</p>

<pre>Magister librum magnum habet.
(The teacher has a large book.)

Magister libros magnos habet.
(The teacher has [some] large books.)</pre>

<p>The great news about adjectives is that
they all have the same endings as one of the noun declensions
you will already have learned. You do have to learn that adjectives
belong to different declensions, but their forms are ones you'll
already know from having memorized the noun declensions earlier.</p>

<h3>Seventh Concept: Verb Tense and Mood</h3>

<p>I'm not going to give you examples of Latin
tenses and moods, but I want to remind you of what tense and
mood are before you start memorizing Latin verb tables.</p>

<p><i>Tense</i>
just means that the form of a verb tells you the <i>time</i>
in which the action described by the verb took place:</p>

<pre>I <i>brought</i> my friend a book. (past tense)

I <i>bring</i> my friend a book. (present tense)

I <i>will bring</i> my friend a book (future tense)</pre>

<p>In both English and Latin, verb tenses
allow speakers and writers of the language to do wonderfully
complicated things, and these things all have complicated names
in the grammar books.</p>

<p>Look at the shifts of time implied by the
verbs in this sentence, for instance:</p>

<p><b>By the time you finish your
study of <i>Lingua Latina</i>, you will have been one of the
most conscientious readers ever to have started the study of
Latin this way.</b></p>

<p>Do you see what the verb lets the sentence
do there? It takes the reader all the way up into a future state
of affairs and lets them look back at it as a completed action
or event.</p>

<p>Complicated tenses like that have complicated
names (in both English and Latin), and these you do have to learn.
But if you get the idea of each tense before you start learning,
you will never have any trouble remembering what each one does.</p>

<p>And Latin verbs &quot;behave&quot; in wonderfully
symmetrical ways: they are easy to memorize once you get a feel
for how each tense is behaving. (This is impossible to explain
ahead of time. You'll see what I mean when you start memorizing
your verb tables.)</p>

<h3>Eighth Concept: Verb Mood</h3>

<p>Verbs come not only in tenses but in moods,
which are, roughly speaking, the &quot;conditions of reality&quot;
in which the action described by the verb takes place.</p>

<p>The two major moods for you as a student
of Latin are going to be the indicative and the subjunctive.</p>

<p>Since Latin uses the subjunctive a lot
more than English, and for much subtler purposes, you're going
to have to memorize the tables and then start reading before
you can really get a feel for what's going on with mood in Latin
verb forms. But I would like you to have some preliminary feel
for the concept.</p>

<p>Roughly, indicative means that the action
reported by the verb &quot;really happened.&quot; That is, it
describes a really-existing state of affairs. (Or one that really
did take place, or that really will take place.) Examples:</p>

<pre>I went to the store.

I am writing a guide to Latin grammar for my students.

I will read Livy when I'm done writing this section.</pre>

<p>The subjunctive, on the other hand, normally
deals with some state of affairs that &quot;departs from reality&quot;
in an essential way. I'm not going to try to illustrate the Latin
subjunctive -- it would only confuse you -- but I want to give
you one English example to show you what's going on. Here is
a sentence with the verb in the subjunctive in English:</p>

<pre>If I were President of the United States, I would institute an award for students who learned Latin.</pre>

<p>The reason the verb is subjunctive there,
in short, is to show that I am asking my listener to imagine
what is called a hypothetical or contrary-to-fact state of affairs.
The little word &quot;were&quot; is doing a lot of work. It is
saying, in effect, &quot;Look, I am <i>not</i> in fact the President
of the United States, but if I <i>were</i> President -- a situation
I am now asking you briefly to imagine as fact -- then I would&quot;
(etc).</p>

<p>Just get this simple distinction between
the indicative and the subjunctive into your head now and the
more complex cases will take care of themselves when you begin
to read <i>Lingua Latina</i>.</p>

<h3>Ninth Concept: Verb Voice</h3>

<p>The voice of a verb is either active or
passive. The best way to understand this concept is to go look
it up in a freshman comp book if you've forgotten. Here is the
principle:</p>

<pre>Active: John cooked the turkey.

Passive: The turkey was cooked by John.</pre>

<p>Got it? Roughly speaking, the active voice
signals that a person is performing or carrying out an action.
The passive voice puts the object of the verb up into the subject
position and says that the action was done &quot;to&quot; it:
&quot;The turkey was cooked by John.&quot;</p>

<p>The active and passive have different forms
in Latin. They're easy to learn and easy to understand. Just
memorize the tables.</p>

<h3>Tenth Concept: Deponent Verbs</h3>

<p>This is the hardest concept you have to
learn when you start studying Latin, and it's hard because there's
nothing like it in English. The idea is simple enough, though:
in Latin, certain verbs that have passive forms have active meanings.
These are called &quot;deponent&quot; verbs.</p>

<p>What makes the concept difficult to deal
with is that there's nothing &quot;intuitive&quot; about it to
a speaker of English. If you could imagine a situation in which
I could say</p>

<pre>The turkey was cooked by John.</pre>

<p>and mean</p>

<pre>John cooked the turkey.</pre>

<p>you'd have a rough idea of what goes on
with deponent verbs. But, unfortunately, English grammar doesn't
allow that.</p>

<p>Latin grammar does. Most grammar books
put off teaching the use of the deponent forms, because they
think that students will only be confused by them. But the Romans
used deponents interchangeably with regular verbs, and <i>Lingua
Latina</i>, to its great credit, starts you right out with them.</p>

<p>So you are going to have to get used to
the idea &quot;passive form, active meaning&quot; pretty early
in your study of Latin.</p>

<p>That's the bad news.</p>

<p>The good news is that, when you memorize
your tables of regular verbs, you'll be learning the passive
forms of all the major conjugations as a matter of course. This
means that you are already learning the deponents without being
aware of it.</p>

<p>In short, learning deponent verbs simply
means that you have to understand something you've already learned
(&quot;this form signals the passive voice&quot;) in a different
way (&quot;Oops: this verb is a deponent, so the passive form
here has an active meaning.&quot;)</p>

<p>Don't let all this talk about passive forms
and active meanings discourage you. It sounds hard right now
because you don't know any Latin verb forms, active or passive.</p>

<p>When you've begun to memorize your tables,
everything will fall into place, and you'll come back to this
section and understand exactly what I'm talking about. (You'll
also say to yourself: &quot;How could I have ever thought that
this was hard?&quot;)</p>

<h2>Stage 2: Memorizing the Forms</h2>

<p>Students today aren't used to memorizing,
so even small tasks of memorization seem hard. But the only way
to really learn Latin is to memorize the major grammatical forms
systematically.</p>

<p>It isn't as hard as it looks. Think of
this: you might have been in a high school play once where you
had to memorize an entire part, or perhaps you had a friend who
had to memorize a part. And maybe your friend wasn't terrifically
bright. (A lot of good actors aren't.)</p>

<p>And yet he or she memorized the part without
any trouble, because they knew that was the only way to get applause
on opening night.</p>

<p>The amount of memorization you have to
do to get ready to read <i>Lingua Latina</i> is less than you'd
have to memorize to be in a high school play. There are two steps
involved:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Write out the tables. To really memorize
grammar, you have to write out the tables repeatedly. (Grammarians
call these &quot;paradigms,&quot; pronounced like &quot;pair
- ah - dimes.&quot; That's because each form in the table shows
you how hundreds or thousands of similar nouns or verbs or adjectives
work in Latin.)</p>

<p>Get a bunch of blank notebooks. Start with
the noun declensions. Write out each declension until you know
it by heart.</p>

<p>When I hit upon the method I'm describing
here, I then wrote out the entire table of noun declensions 200
times. When I'd finished the nouns, I went on to the adjectives.
(These I wrote out only 100 times, since I knew all the forms
from having written out the nouns.) I kept count in my notebook
of how many tmes I'd written out each set of tables. This was
forty years ago. Since then, I've never not known the noun and
adjective declensions by heart.</p>

<p>Then I did the regular verbs in the indicative
active. Then in the indicative passive. Then the subjunctives.
I wrote each set of these out 200 times. The whole process took
about six months.</p>

<p>Since &quot;Learning Latin by the Dowling
Method&quot; first went up on the web, though, I've had a lot
of mail from people who told me that they found that writing
out the nouns, adjectives, and verbs 100 times was enough to
let them get started on <i>Lingua Latin</i> (see below) with
a firm grasp of how Latin grammar as a whole works. That may
be right. I'm not sorry that I began with doing everything 200
times -- it was tedious, but tedium gloriously spent -- but if
100 times works for some people, there's probably no reason to
overdo.</p>

<p>Also, since this page first appeared on
the internet, a generous soul has put up a simple feature called
&quot;<A HREF="http://www.jonathanaquino.com/latin/">Dowling's
Wheel</A>,&quot; which lets you fill in the blanks in the declensions
and the conjugations at the keyboard. I have no idea whether
or not this works as well as writing them out by hand -- to be
honest, I doubt that it does: the transmission of memory from
the brain through the hand to the page seems to me somehow a
more &quot;permanent&quot; process -- but those who want to try
it may click on the link earlier in this paragraph. I'd be glad
to hear from people who have tried Dowling's Wheel and found
that it works as well as handwritten transcription.</p>

<p>Finally, a caveat. Whenever someone suggests
a program for thorough learning, it won't be long before people
come up with &quot;easier&quot; versions to try to trick you
into believing that you can avoid a lot of the effort involved.
In the modern languages, for instance, there are hundreds of
programs with titles like &quot;French in Three Months,&quot;
and &quot;Learn Italian While You Drive,&quot; and &quot;Romanian
the Easy Way.&quot; They are all utterly fraudulent.</p>

<p>When I was growing up, I remember seeing
ads in <i>Life</i> magazine for records that promised to let
you &quot;learn German (or French, or Norwegian) while you sleep!&quot;
The idea was that you'd put on a record just as you were drifting
off, and some subliminal process would magically install a knowledge
of grammar and vocabulary in your slumbering brain.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be surprised to see people trying
to modify the Dowling method so that you could, for instance,
learn just one noun declension and then start right in reading
<i>Lingua Latina</i> and then zip along effortlessly to a fluent
reading knowledge of Latin in three weeks. In contemporary culture,
that sort of thing is inevitable. Still, I think you'd be well
advised to steer clear of such modifications, and especially
of any version that promises to let you learn Latin grammar while
you sleep.</p></li>

<li><p>Finally, an important trick. I used
it when I was inventing this method, and it did wonders to strengthen
the memorization process. Say the paradigms to yourself. When
you're going through the &quot;memorization stage,&quot; use
the dead time that occurs during the day to <i>say</i> the paradigms
to yourself.</p>

<p>If you're waiting for a bus or standing
in line in a store or waiting to see the doctor, repeat a noun
declension or a verb conjugation. The amount of &quot;dead time&quot;
that occurs during a normal day is amazing, and if you use it
efficiently you will speed up the memorization process by a tremendous
amount.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Stage 3: <i>Lingua Latina</i></h2>
<p>This is the exciting part.</p>

<p>When you've written out all your tables
200 times each, you are ready to start reading volume I of <i>Lingua
Latina</i>. This is a &quot;direct method&quot; book that starts
you off with very simple Latin, and that tells a story about
a Roman family living around the time of Augustus. It is a work
of pedagogical genius.</p>

<p>The book is very hard to find in American
bookstores. Almost impossible, in fact. But the wonderful thing
is that, in this age of the Web, you can order it online. Just
click here on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Alingua%20latina">Lingua
Latina</a>.</p>

<p>It has wonderful exercises and introduces
grammatical concepts and vocabulary very gradually, so that you're
almost not aware that you're learning new things as you go along.
But you go from the simplest Latin sentences to reading unaltered
Livy in a series of easy, graduated steps.</p>

<p>When you've finished <i>Lingua Latina</i>,
you can read any Latin you encounter. You will have a very large
Latin vocabulary and lots of practice with grammar, so for the
rest of your life all you'll need to do is keep on reading to
stay in practice.</p>

<p>Here's how to use <i>Lingua Latina</i>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Read slowly, and make sure that you
understand the grammatical function of every word. This is absolutely
essential. If you start with the first lesson and read the sentences
so that you &quot;sort of get the idea of the sentence,&quot;
all your memorization and practice will be wasted.</p>

<p>You've got to ask yourself what the case
of every noun is as you read -- and ask yourself why it's in
that case -- and the tense and mood of every verb, and make sure
you understand the prepositions, the adjectives and the adverbs.
But if you do this, you will understand every sentence perfectly,
and your Latin reading ability will increase by leaps and bounds.</p></li>

<li><p>When you've finished each lesson, study
the grammar section until you understand its presentation of
the material you have already memorized. This is where your &quot;partial
understanding&quot; of the forms in the tables becomes &quot;real&quot;
understanding. You've got to take the grammar sections slowly
and read them aloud until you are sure you understand all the
material.</p></li>

<li><p>Then take a notebook and write out a
complete version of each Pensum excercise. The pensa are the
best thing about <i>Lingua Latina</i>. At the end of each chapter,
you must be able to fill out each pensum without looking back
at the chapter to check grammatical forms. If you have to check
back, then you need to read the chapter all over again, slowly,
until you can do the pensa out of your own head.</p>

<p>Keep a separate Pensum Notebook for your
exercises. Clearly indicate the chapter and section of each pensum.
When you've completed all three exercises, then you may go back
to the chapter to see that all your answers are correct. (Do
the pensa in black ink, mark your answers in red. Then when you
come back to check your work several weeks or months from now,
it will be clear to you what you mastered easily and what you
needed to study more.)</p></li>

<li><p>Repeat this process for each chapter
until you have completed all of <i>Lingua Latina</i>. When you've
done this, you will be a competent reader of Latin, both poetry
and prose. From now on, all you have to do is keep in practice
and you will be a respectable Latinist for the rest of your life.</p></li>
</ol>

Professor Dowling describes the best means of apprehending Latin: memorizing all the noun declensions, then all the adjective declensions, then all the verb conjugations. He dissents from the usual recommendation of Wheelock, the popular Latin for beginners book, but does say that the grammar tables in the back with all the declensions and conjugations (it is very comprehensive) are the most useful part of the book.

I accomplished the full repetitions of all the Latin nouns, adjectives, and verbs back in June. It took about two weeks. But then, I did it constantly, and though I made sure to do the first set of fifty or so by hand, I finished the rest by typing on the computer (I'm a much faster typist), which was just as effective, if not more so due to the clear, printed style of the computerized text.

Now they're all memorized, and ingrained, and I could write most of the grammatical tables from Wheelock from memory. It makes apprehension of Latin infinitely easier, and I think it's the only way to catch up with the ancient Roman children, to ingrain the grammar as well as their young minds ingrained it for them. In short, it has been very effective.

After &quot;brute memorization&quot; of the grammatical forms, one proceeds to Lingua Latina, a tremendous book, all in Latin, that teaches Latin via the &quot;direct method,&quot; like a children's book, comprehensible and self-instructive from the very first sentence. It is a wondrous novel, actually, a novella in its own right with a beautiful little story that follows the day-to-day routine of a Roman family.

I am now more than two thirds of the way through the first volume, and I am simply astounded at how my Latin skills have improved. Every few chapters I've been looking back at random pages of Caesar's Gallic Wars, rejoicing how each time my intuitive grasp of random selections of the text has leapt forward by fantastic strides &#151; to say nothing of how entertaining the Lingua Latina story is.

<h2>Good Luck</h2>

<p>One last principle.
The only way to learn a language is to
work on it every day.</p>

<p>This is something most people never figure
out, and it is why most people are no good at languages.</p>

<p>This isn't simply a matter of &quot;discipline.&quot;
It has something to do with the learning process -- my guess
is, with the way the synapses in your brain work when you're
learning grammar and syntax.</p>

<p>If you work on a hit-or-miss basis, missing
an occasional day and then trying to make up for it by putting
in twice as much time the next day you study Latin, you'll never
learn the language. My motto: it is far better to put in 30 minutes
every day for seven days (3 1/2 hours) than to wait until Saturday
and put in 8 straight hours then.</p>

<p>Don't ask me why this is so. I'm not a
neurologist. But I have spent over 30 years studying languages,
and I'm telling you it's true.</p>

<p>The matter of &quot;discipline&quot; comes
in this way. Even when you make up your mind to do your Latin
every day, life has a way of intruding so that you will be tempted
to miss days. There will be crises and upsets and intrusions
and excitements, and your feeling will be that &quot;missing
just one day can't hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>It does hurt. You've got to do your Latin
every day, through death and disease and accidents and heartbreak,
when you're travelling and when you're at home, when you're in
school and when you're on vacation.</p>

<p>The best way to do this is: do your Latin
first thing every morning, before you do anything else. Then,
no matter what happens for the rest of day, they can't take your
Latin lesson away from you.</p>

<p>When you're travelling, take your <i>Lingua
Latina</i> along with you. When I was first starting to use the
method I'm describing here, I did an amazing amount of Latin
on buses and trains and sitting around airports.</p>

<p>It's interesting and fun, and it beats
watching the fat lady over at the Baskin &amp; Robbins stand
buy her kid an ice cream cone.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
